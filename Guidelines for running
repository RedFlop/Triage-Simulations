How to run the simulations:

1. Make sure you have the latest stable version of python 3 for your operating system installed. Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Then install SimPy by following the instructions here: https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/installation.html
3. Once both Python and SimPy are installed run Model 1 and Model 2 like you would run any other Python code.

Potential issues:
1. SimPy hasn't been installed in the same path or enviorment as Python and can therefore not be found by python when being imported in the code.
2. The code can take long to run since NUM_RUNS is set to a high value of 100,000. To run the simulations faster try lowering the value to a lower value such as 5,000.
